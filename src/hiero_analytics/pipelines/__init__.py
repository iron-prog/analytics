"""Registry of analytics pipelines.

Each pipeline lives in this package as a module exposing a ``main()`` entry
point. The :data:`PIPELINES` registry below is the single place a pipeline
declares its name, description, CLI options, offline capability, and whether it
belongs to the default full run — the CLI (``hiero_analytics.cli``) and the
orchestrator (``hiero_analytics.pipelines.run_all``) are both driven by it.

To add a pipeline: create ``<name>.py`` here with a ``main()`` function and
append a :class:`Pipeline` entry to :data:`PIPELINES` (the record type lives
in ``_registry``).
