"""How each KPI tile is derived — the tile's "how to read this" and steps.

A tile is a single number with no axis, no rows, and nothing to click through
to, so it is the easiest figure on the dashboard to misread. Every tile
therefore carries the same annotation a chart does: what it counts, and the
steps that produced it. Keyed by the tile's label, which is what the reader
sees; the values themselves come from ``export/macro_metrics.py``.

Pure data: definitions may mark emphasis with ``*asterisks*``; no other markup.
