"""Releases — GitHub Releases cadence and staleness.

Its own tab rather than a Governance sub-section: release staleness isn't
governance-dependent or period-scoped (see analysis/releases.py and the
design discussion on hiero-hackers/analytics#331), so it doesn't fit
Governance's period-tabbed, governance-config-gated shape. Pure data; see
the package __init__ for assembly.
