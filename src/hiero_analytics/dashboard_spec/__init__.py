"""Declarative spec for the dashboard — one module per dashboard family.

Pure data consumed by the dashboard pipeline. Each family module declares its
chart macro plus the notes/methodology/wide-chart sets for its charts; a
family with table sections (contributors, governance) also declares
``SECTION_SPECS``/``SECTION_GROUPS``. This package assembles the families in
display order (helpers in ``_assembly``) and exposes the table-bearing
families per macro name, so the dashboard pipeline renders each family's
tables inside its own macro.
